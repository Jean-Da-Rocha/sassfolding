## Introduction

Setting up a new project has always been a real hassle for me: configuring tools, setting up linting, installing
packages, and—more importantly—making it collaborative.

That’s why I decided to create a reusable boilerplate that lets you scaffold a project quickly, with almost zero
configuration, thanks to the power of Docker and a few Make commands.

While the boilerplate is opinionated in terms of tooling, project structure, and code conventions, I hope you’ll still
find useful ideas or inspiration within it.

## Features

- 🐳 Docker-first development setup (Laravel, Hybridly, Node, Redis, Mailpit, RustFS, Traefik)
- ⚡ One-liner setup via **make install**
- 🧪 Preconfigured **.env** and **.env.testing** environments
- 🔏 SSL certificates with **mkcert** + **.test** TLD with local DNS resolver
- 🛠️ Built-in support for Husky Git hooks
- 📦 Modern stack (Pnpm, Tailwind CSS, Laravel, Hybridly, Nuxt UI, etc.)
- ✨ Code linting and formatting preconfigured (ESLint, Pint, etc.)
- 🔎 Robust types enforcement (Vue-TSC, PHPStan, Laravel Typescript-Transformer)
- 🥦 Taze: modern CLI tool to keep front-end dependencies up-to-date
- 📱 Fully responsive
- 🌓 Light & Dark Mode

## Architecture

This project follows a **modular monolith** architecture where each module is self-contained with its own routes,
controllers, models, views, migrations, and tests.

### Module Dependency Rules

```

### Module Types

| Type           | Modules              | Can Import From                       | Can Be Imported By    |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Foundation     | Core                 | Laravel/Vendor, Users\Data            | All modules           |
| Infrastructure | Datatables           | Core                                  | All modules           |
| Domain         | Users                | Core, Datatables                      | All (Model/Data only) |
| Feature        | Authentication, Menus| Core, Datatables, Users (Model/Data)  | None                  |

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Why Hybridly over Inertia?**

Hybridly provides tighter Laravel integration with features like automatic TypeScript type generation from PHP,
native table support, and a more Laravel-centric API. It bridges Laravel and Vue while maintaining strong typing
across the stack.

**Why RustFS over MinIO?**

MinIO entered maintenance mode in December 2025, with no new features and Docker images removed from public registries.
RustFS is a Rust-based, S3-compatible alternative that offers better performance (2.3x throughput for small objects)
and active development.

### Enforcing Boundaries

Architecture tests in `modules/Core/Tests/Architecture/` enforce these rules at CI time:

```bash
# Run architecture tests
./vendor/bin/pest --filter=Architecture
```

These tests will fail if:
- Core imports from any other module
- Feature modules import from each other
- Users Actions are used outside the Users module
- Controllers don't extend the base Controller
- Data objects don't extend Spatie\LaravelData\Data

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have installed:

- [Docker (with docker compose >= 2.20.3)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should first read the documentation
> [here](https://github.com/Jean-Da-Rocha/sassfolding-docker-local/blob/main/README.md) to get a good understanding on
> how docker powers this project.

- ```git clone https://github.com/Jean-Da-Rocha/sassfolding.git```
- ```cd sassfolding && make install```

Based on the `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}` variable (**sassfolding** in our case), the installation process will
automatically do the following:

- Create the dedicated .env files, replacing the `${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}` variable in those files
- Generate SSL certificates for HTTPS
- Configure husky hooks
- Build the docker images
- Install pnpm & composer dependencies
- Generate keys for both .env and .env.testing files
- Define the **DNSMASQ_FORWARD_PORT** to use based on your operating system
- Configure a DNS resolver based on .test Top-Level Domain (TLD)
- Create the **sassfolding** and **sassfolding_testing** databases
- Start the containers in detached mode

You can always run ```make help``` in your console to see which commands are available.

> [!TIP]
> Don’t forget to run `make artisan cmd="migrate"` to run your migrations and `make composer cmd="autocomplete"`
> to enable autocompletion based on your database structure.

## Usage

Once the docker containers are running, you can access the following URL:

- **https://app.sassfolding.test** - The main application
- **https://horizon.sassfolding.test** - The Laravel Horizon dashboard to monitor your Redis queues
- **https://mail.sassfolding.test** - The Mailpit dashboard to receive your emails locally
- **https://rustfs.sassfolding.test** - The RustFS dashboard to manage files, folders and buckets
- **https://traefik.sassfolding.test** - The Traefik dashboard to view your entrypoints, routes etc.

*Note: There is a middleware called **EnsureValidHorizonUri** to make sure Horizon dashboard and its API
remain protected and scoped*

> [!CAUTION]
> To make Laravel Horizon work with the docker setup, the HORIZON_PATH= variable in your .env should stay empty.
